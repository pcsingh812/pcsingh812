## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Priyanka!

After years of handling escalations, creating reports, and optimizing service operations, I realized I was spending a lot of time making sense of dataâ€”but I wanted to leverage that data in ways that could directly drive business success. So, I decided to step into the world of business analytics, where I could take that same problem-solving mindset and apply it to business challenges, turning raw data into strategic insights that guide decision-making.
